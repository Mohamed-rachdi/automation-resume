# Dynamic Resume Generator

## Project Overview
This project aims to generate a dynamic, customized resume that aligns with specific job offers. Initially, users provide their complete profile information (name, phone number, email, skills, experiences, etc.). Then, for every job offer they receive, the user can input the job details into a chatbot interface. The system processes the job offer using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and generates a resume folder tailored to match the job requirements.

## Features
- **User Profile Initialization:** Users input their complete personal and professional details only once.
- **Job Offer Analysis:** The system extracts key requirements from the job offer provided by the user.
- **Customized Resume Generation:** Automatically creates a resume that emphasizes the most relevant skills and experiences for the specific job offer.
- **Chatbot Integration:** Provides a user-friendly interface where users interact with the system by inputting job offers.
- **Resume Folder Creation:** Generates a folder containing the tailored resume and any additional documents.
